### Time frames (not the same as time boxes for tasks)

I always had some kind of semi-functional task list in place, but my work organisation
was still hardly existent at all. It wasn't until I started to use time framing that this changed.

Time frame is a block of time you give to a project. Your schedule is then time frames of a day

```
Morning routine (from 7:50)
Admin (from 9:20)
Work for client 1 (10:00 – 12:00)
Lunch break (12:00 – 13)
Work for client 2 (13 – 18)
```

### Schedules

You are likely to have more schedules than one. I have one for Tuesday when I have
a class from 6 and therefore I have to move my work session earlier, one for Wednesday
when I have my Spanish class in the morning, one for the other work days,
one for Saturday and one for Sunday.

Using the [holidays gem](https://github.com/holidays/holidays) you can easily
chose your Sunday schedule for a bank holiday.

I have a different morning routine on Mondays and Thursdays, I go swimming, but
since it fits into the given time frame, I do this in automatically scheduled tasks
while keeping the schedule the same.
