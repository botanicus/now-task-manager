# The API

- Specs & help.

1. Finish the commands and their specs.
   If all commands work, we don't have to worry to fuck with the API.

   Refactoring:
    helpers
    Commit, Done, MoveOn, NextFail, Next_Postpone, Next, Postpone: abort "<red>There is no task in progress.</red>" # TODO: raise NoTaskInProgress.

    BitBar, nextdone, nextfail, nextpostpone, plan, review, run, show-schedule/schedule, test
    config, edit, Generate, report
    MoveOn: so far not being used

   Help & desc.

3. The API: refactoring, API docs and specs.

# The rest

1. Documentation
   README.md, doc, man (formats, tutorial?), gemspec & yardopts, support/*/README.md.

2. Support/vim
