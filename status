# The API

1. Finish the commands and their specs.
   If all commands work, we don't have to worry to fuck with the API.

   Refactoring:
    helpers
    Commit, Done, MoveOn, NextFail, Next_Postpone, Next, Postpone: abort "<red>There is no task in progress.</red>" # TODO: raise NoTaskInProgress.

    BitBar, nextdone, nextfail, nextpostpone, plan, review, run, show-schedule/schedule, test
    config, edit, Generate, report
    MoveOn: so far not being used

   Help & desc.

2. Change the commander to support subcommands.
   Command should do one thing, but we should be able to group them intelligently.
   There should be help for subcommands available via i. e. `now -h active`.
   Man pages main + POSSIBLY for subcommands.
   Update support/zsh.

    now active {<main>,done,postpone,fail,move_on,commit}
    now next {<main>,start(+run),done,postpone,fail}
    now edit
    now g
    now +
    now config
    now report
    now console
    now schedule {show,test}
    now plan
    now review
    now test

3. The API: refactoring, API docs and specs.

# The rest

1. Documentation
   README.md, doc, man (formats, tutorial?), gemspec & yardopts, support/*/README.md.

2. Support/vim
