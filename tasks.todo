Tasks:
- Decide what's the approach to durations: either recommended duration or hard-core duration, that is run the timer and move on. Or both. Does it make sense to add expected/actual duration metadata? If hard-core duration is running, show the timer in the bitbar.
- Add support for nested time frames.
- pomodoro start-now: reframe based on durations
- Online only if "Call|Interview ... on Skype" OR if the time frame is defined a priori with {online: true}.
- Pomodoro: loop that runs and notifies about new time frames and shows notes.
- BitBar: show each project TODO.
- [30] Pomodoro: add stats about total minutes expected and actual to the backup.
- Defined tasks: their commands are defined, but they are not in todays task since it's irrelevant.
